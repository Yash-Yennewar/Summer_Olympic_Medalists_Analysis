## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Summer Olympic Medallists dataset (1896--2008)** to uncover historical trends, country dominance, sport specialization, athlete achievements,
and gender participation using **Python data analysis libraries**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

-   Analyze medal distribution across Olympic editions
-   Identify top-performing countries and sports
-   Study athlete-level achievements
-   Explore gender participation trends over time
-   Evaluate medal quality using weighted scoring

---
